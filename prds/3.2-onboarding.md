# PRD 3.2 — Onboarding Flow

**Phase:** 3 — Core Product Features
**Type:** NEW
**Complexity:** Medium
**Dependencies:** Task 1.2 (Dialog component), Task 1.9 (WhiteLabel fixes)

---

## Goal

Convert new signups into active users by teaching them the product's value in 60 seconds.

---

## Target User

First-time user who just completed signup. No prior knowledge of the product.

---

## Success Metrics

- Onboarding completion rate > 80%
- Time to first newsletter creation < 5 minutes post-onboarding
- 7-day retention improvement vs direct-to-dashboard

---

## User Flow

1. Signup completes → redirect to `/onboarding` instead of `/dashboard`
2. **Step 1 — Welcome:** Animated hero, value prop, "Get Started" CTA
3. **Step 2 — Knowledge Base:** Explain sources, show supported types, optional "Add your first source" action
4. **Step 3 — Repurposing:** Show newsletter-to-social flow, preview of what AI creates
5. **Step 4 — Complete:** Congrats, "Create your first newsletter" CTA, "Explore dashboard" secondary CTA
6. **Skip button** on any step → goes to dashboard immediately
7. Flag set on profile so onboarding never shows again

---

## Out of Scope

- Interactive tutorials with click-through product tours
- Video walkthroughs
- Animated pointer overlays

## Implementation Subtasks

- [ ] 3.2.1: Add `has_completed_onboarding: boolean DEFAULT false` column to `profiles` table (migration)
- [ ] 3.2.2: Create `pages/OnboardingPage.tsx` with step state machine (4 steps)
- [ ] 3.2.3: Build Step 1 — Welcome: animated illustration (CSS), value proposition copy, progress dots
- [ ] 3.2.4: Build Step 2 — Knowledge Base intro: icon grid of source types, brief explanation
- [ ] 3.2.5: Build Step 3 — Repurposing intro: before/after mockup showing newsletter becoming social posts
- [ ] 3.2.6: Build Step 4 — Completion: celebration state, primary CTA (create newsletter), secondary CTA (explore)
- [ ] 3.2.7: Add skip button on every step — calls API to set `has_completed_onboarding = true`
- [ ] 3.2.8: Add route `/onboarding` in App.tsx (protected)
- [ ] 3.2.9: Modify `ProtectedRoute` or `DashboardLayout` to check `profile.has_completed_onboarding` and redirect to `/onboarding` if false
- [ ] 3.2.10: Mobile responsive — steps must work on 375px viewport
- [ ] 3.2.11: Test full flow: signup → onboarding → dashboard. Verify onboarding only shows once.
